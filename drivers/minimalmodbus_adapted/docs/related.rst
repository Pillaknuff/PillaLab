The MinimalModbus module is intended for easy-to-use communication with 
instruments using the Modbus (RTU and ASCII) protocol. 
There are a few other Python modules for Modbus protocol implementation. 
For more advanced use, you should consider using one of these:

pyModbus 
    From https://github.com/bashwork/pymodbus: 'Pymodbus is a full Modbus protocol implementation using twisted for its asynchronous communications core.'

modbus-tk
    From https://github.com/ljean/modbus-tk: 'Make possible to write modbus TCP and RTU master and slave mainly for testing purpose. It is shipped with slave simulator and a master with a web-based hmi. It is a full-stack implementation and as a consequence could also be used on real-world project.'
